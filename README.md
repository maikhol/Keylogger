## Description:
Keylogger made in python. 
Keystrokes of user's will be saved and be sent over to a server; which can be seen/save.

I am not promoting malicious attacks or intents. This short program was for learning purposes.
That being said, not all steps will not be shown to compile file.
To avoid Windows and Linux machines detecting this file to be flagged as a virus, its was compiled with a C++ compiler.

Keylogger executable was cleverly hidden (not going to go indepth about this)
The server side had a short list of lines to run and can be ran indefinately. Used node.js to make this work.
